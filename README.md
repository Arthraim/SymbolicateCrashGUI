# SymbolicateCrashGUI
A GUI for easy use case of SymbolicateCrash

## Why?
When someone sends me a crash log, I need to symbolicate it with drawf/xcrun, that's really pain in ass.

## Usage
Drag .app .dSYM .crash files into the window, once 3 files are all ready, app will automatically start symbolicating them.
When the work is done, app will open the symbolicated crash file for you.
Also, the symblicated crash file will be in a new 'symbolicateWorkspace' folder on your desktop.

## TODOs
see issue [#1](https://github.com/Arthraim/SymbolicateCrashGUI/issues/1)

It's my first Mac app, really bad experience huh, so... __PR is welcome!__
